## RFishBC <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="200" hspace="15" />

The **RFishBC** package helps fisheries scientists collect measurements from calcified structures and back-calculate estimated lengths at previous ages. **RFishBC** is intended to replace much of the functionality provided by the now out-date fishBC software.

### Use

General desriptions for using **RFishBC** are under the *Vignettes* tab at the top of the page. I suggest at least quickly reading each vignette to get an overall feel for **RFishBC** and then following the workflow suggestions in the last vignette. Detailed descriptions for each function are under the *Reference* tab at the top of the page.

### Installation

**RFishBC** is now available on CRAN and can be installed as usual from there. The most recent development version (on GitHub) of **RFishBC** may be installed by running the two lines below in your R console.

```r
if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools'); require('devtools')
devtools::install_github('droglenc/RFishBC')
```

You may need to have R Tools installed on your system to use the two lines above. See the instructions for ([R Tools for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) or [R Tools for Mac OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/)). Additionally, you may need the X11 graphics functionality if using Mac OS.
