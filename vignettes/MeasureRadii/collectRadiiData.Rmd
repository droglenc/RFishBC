# Introduction
The size of fish at a previous time in their life is often estimated through "back-calculation." Back-calculation of previous lengths requires accurate measurements of annual growth on calcified structures from individual fish and a suitable model that relates growth on the structure to growth of the fish.

The [FishBC software](https://fisheries.org/bookstore/all-titles/software/70317/) is commonly used to measure lengths on a calcified structure and apply a back-calculation model to estimate length at previous ages. However, FishBC only works on out-dated computers, there are no plans to update it, and it is not open source. The functionality in the `RFishBC` package is meant to replace FishBC. Methods for making measurements on images of calcified structures is demonstrated in this vignette. Using those measurements to back-calculate fish length at a previous age is demonstrated in the [Compute Back-Calculated Lengths](../BCCalc/BCCalc.html) vignette.

# Vignette Assumptions

### Understand Back-Calculation
This vignette assumes that you have a basic understanding of back-calculating fish length at previous ages as described in the [Short Introduction to Back-Calculation](../BCIntro/BCIntro.html) vignette. At the very least you should be aware of what calcified structures and radial measurements are.

### Static Structure Images
This vignette also assumes that you have static digital images of structures. The images must be of jpeg (.jpg), portable network graphics (.png), bitmap (.bmp), or TIFF format. Images will usually be obtained from a camera mounted on a microscope and connected to a computer. Below is an image of a Kiyi (*Coregonus kiyi*) scale.

![](Scale_1.jpg)

\  

Ideally, but not necessarily, the image will also contain an object (e.g., a "scale-bar") of known length so that actual lengths on the structure can be found. If a scale-bar is absent, then the measured lengths will be on an arbitrary scale (i.e., the actual values will be meaningless but the proportion of the total structure radius to each annulus will be meaningful). An image of a Kiyi otolith with a 1-mm scale-bar is shown in sections below.

The process described herein requires all images to be processed to be in the same directory or folder. To be most efficient (and simple), this directory should contain ONLY image files related to a particular project (e.g., one species for one water body for one year) and all image files should be of the same type (e.g., png or jpg).

The working directory of R should be set to the directory that contains the images. The working directory may be set with `setwd()`. The following is an example of setting a working directory in R.

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("c:/work/aging/Kiyi2014")
```

The working directory may also be set by interactively selecting the directory through a dialog box using the following code.[^RStudioSETWD]
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd(choose.dir())
```

Finally, note that the process described herein will produce one RData object file (.RData files; hereafter called "RData file") for each set of measurements made on a structure image. These data files will be saved in the current work directory (likely the directory with the structure image files). I suggest keeping the RData and corresponding structure image files together at all times as the RData file serves as an archive of the data collected from an image.

### R Packages
The methods described in this vignette require the following packages.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(RFishBC)
library(dplyr)    # for mutate(), inner_join()
library(tidyr)    # for spread()
```

# Measure Radii {#measurereadii}
The `digitizeRadii()` function is used to

1. Load a structure image.
1. Optionally provide a scale for the image.
1. Interactively select the structure focus and margin (to form a transect on which annuli will be marked).
1. Interactively select annuli on the structure image.
1. Create an RData file that contains the radial measurements to selected annuli and other information about the structure and the data extraction process.

For example (*but described thoroughly further below*), the line below identifies "Scale_1.jpg" as the structure image, this fish has an identification number of "1", this reading of the image should be labelled as "DHO", and the structure margin or edge should not be considered as an annulus. When this line is run it will open the image[^inwd], allow the user to select points that represent a transect and annuli on that transect, and save radial measurements to "Scale_1_DHO.RData".[^saveex1]

```{r eval=FALSE}
digitizeRadii("Scale_1.jpg",id="1",reading="DHO",edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE)
```

Further specifics of `digitizeRadii()` and many of its arguments[^DRargs] are described below.

### Basics
The `digitizeRadii()` function requires only three arguments.

* `img`: File name for the structure image. This is just the file name if the file is in the current working directory. However it may be the fully pathed name if the image file is not in the current working directory. A dialog box will be provided from which the image file can be selected if this argument is not given and you are on a Windows machine.
* `id=`: The **required** unique identifier for the fish/structure. If this argument is missing, then the ID can be entered in a dialog box if using Windows or in the console. The Windows dialog will be populated with the filename (sans the extension) if the `popID=TRUE` argument is included.
* `edgeIsAnnulus=`: A **required** logical that indicates whether the point selected at the structure margin should be considered an annulus (`edgeIsAnnulus=TRUE`) or not (`edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE`). If the fish was captured such that the margin shows growth, but not a complete year's worth of growth, then use `edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE`. However, if the fish was captured before the current year's growth has commenced or after it has completed then use `edgeIsAnnulus=TRUE`. Identifying whether the structure margin is an annulus or not is critical to properly recording radial measurements. As such, there is no default value for this argument (i.e., it **MUST** be set by the user).

Other arguments that are likely to be commonly used are:

* `reading=`: Optional label for the reading.[^readings]
* `description=`: Optional detailed description about the structure. This will be saved in the RData file and could be extracted in the future. For example, one may use `description="Cisco scale read once by Ogle on 22-Apr-18"` to provide more information about the structure reading.
* `sepWindow=`: A logical that indicates whether the image should be opened in a separate window (`sepWindow=TRUE`) or not (`sepWindow=FALSE`). The default is `sepWindow=TRUE` as opening the image in a separate window allows it to conform to its native aspect ratio, which is important when meausuring distances on the image.
* `windowSize=`: A value that sets the size of the separate window (only used if `sepWindow=TRUE`). This value will become the larger of the two dimensions, with the other value proportionate so that the original aspect ratio is maintained. Use `windowSize=` to "zoom in" on an image. Note that the default is `windowSize=7`; so values larger than 7 represent a "zooming in."

Finally, note that the RData file that will be created after the annuli have been selected will have the same name as the image file[^excludeextension] but including the suffix optionally provided in `suffix=`. If nothing is given in `suffix=`, then a suffix will be created from `reading=` (if it exists). For example, if the structure image file was named "Scale_1.jpg", then the resultant RData file will be named "Scale_1_DHO.RData" if `reading="DHO"` or "Scale_1_TESTING.RData" if `reading="DHO"` and `suffix="TESTING"`.

By default the ID will be shown in the top-left corner of the image. This may be moved by giving a different location to `pos.info=`. For example, `pos.info="bottomright"` would move this information to the bottom-right corner of the image. The color of this info may be changed with `col.info=` and the relative size may be changed with `cex.info=`.

At this point, the image may look something like that below.

![](figures/oto140306_A.jpg)

\  

Other arguments to `digitizeRadii()` are described in the specific sections below.

### Setting the Scale
If actual lengths, rather than arbitrary (but proportional) lengths are needed,[^actuallength] then a scaling factor is needed to convert measurements on the image to actual measurements on the structure. This scaling factor may be calculated from a scale-bar found on the image or provided by the user.

**Scale-bar On Image:** If a scale-bar of known length exists on the image, then use `scaleBar=TRUE` with the actual length of the scale bar given in `scaleBarLength=`. You will then need to select the two end points of the scale-bar on the structure image prior to selecting points that represent annuli. An appropriate scaling factor will then be computed from your selections and the radial measurements on the image will be converted to actual lengths on the structure.

**Separately Defined Scaling Factor:** In applications where a scale-bar does not exist on the image, the user can provide a value to `scalingFactor=` which will be used to multiply lengths on the structure image to derive actual lengths. One way to derive this scaling factor is to capture an image of the structure at a specific magnification on the microscope and then capture an image of an object of known length at that same magnification. Note that these captured images should be of the same size so that the aspect ratio is consistent. A scaling factor may then be computed from the image with the object of known length and applied to the structure image. This scaling factor can be found by giving `findScalingFactor()` the file name with the object of known length and that known length in `knownLength=`. The value returned from `findScalingFactor()` can then be given to `scalingFactor=` in `digitizeRadii()`.[^sforder]

If no `scalingFactor=` is derived from a scale-bar or provided, then the radial measurements returned by `digitizeRadii()` are simply proportional to the unknown actual lengths on the structure.

At this point, the image may look something like that below.

![](figures/oto140306_B.jpg)

\  

### Selecting a Transect
After the scaling factor has been determined, you will be asked to select a transect on the structure image on which annular marks will be selected. This transect is selected by **first selecting the structure focus** and **then selecting the structure margin/edge**. If `showTransect=TRUE` (the default), then a line connecting these two points will be drawn on the structure image. The color of the transect may be changed with `col.transect=`. The width of the transect may be increased by including a number greater than 1 in `lwd.transect=`.

At this point, the image may look something like that below.

![](figures/oto140306_C.jpg)

\  

### Selecting Annuli
Once a transect has been identified on the structure, then you will be asked to select points on the structure that represent annuli. Points are selected by clicking on the image at the point with the first (left) mouse button. Be careful in your selections because the point cannot be immediately removed. When the last point has been selected, the user must press the second (right) mouse button and select 'Stop' or, in Windows, select 'STOP' in the menu on the structure image window.

Selected points will be marked with the plotting character given in `pch.sel=` (defaults to "cross-hairs") with a color given in `col.sel=`.

In theory all selected points should fall on the selected transect. In practice, you may select a point slightly off of the transect. The selected point can be "moved" perpendicularly to fall exactly on the transect by including `snap2Transect=TRUE`, which is the default behavior.

At this point, the image may look something like that below.

![](figures/oto140306_D.jpg)

\  

When you have finished selecting points, information about your selections, including the calculated radial measurements, are saved to the RData file. The contents of this file are described further [here](http://derekogle.com/RFishBC/reference/digitizeRadii.html#value).


# Setting Argument Defaults for a Session {#setoptions1}

As described above, the `digitizeRadii()` function has several arguments that provide flexibility when measuring radii on the images. The default values for all of these arguments can be seen with `RFBCoptions()` (i.e., without any arguments). The value for any argument can be seen by appending the argument name to `RFBCoptions()` with a `$`. For example, the current setting for the `showTransect` argument is `TRUE` as shown below.
```{r}
RFBCoptions()$showTransect
```

Default values for these arguments may be changed within `digitizeRadii()`. For example, the code below sets the "reading" label to "DHO", the edge to not be considered an annulus, the width of the transect line to be thicker, and a scale-bar is present with a known length of 0.6 mm. You can set these items in `digitizeRadii()` as below.
```{r eval=FALSE}
digitizeRadii("Scale_1.jpg",id="1",reading="DHO",edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE,
              lwd.transect=3,scaleBar=TRUE,scaleBarLength=0.6)
```

However, changing the arguments withing `digitizeRadii()` like this is inefficient if you will be processing many images with the same arguments. Thus, the default values for these arguments can be set for the entire session (i.e., until you change them or close R and open it again) by including the argument name set equal to the desired default value within `RFBCoptions()`. For example, if the code below is run at the beginning of a session (i.e., early in the script), then every call to `digitizeRadii()` after that will default to using "DHO" as the reading label, not treating the edge as an annulus, using a thicker line for the transect, and identifying that a scale-bar with a known length of 0.6 exists on the image.
```{r eval=FALSE}
RFBC(reading="DHO",edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE,lwd.transect=3,
     scaleBar=TRUE,scaleBarLength=0.6)
```

With these changes to the default settings, the last call to `digitizeRadii()` above could be simplified as shown below.
```{r eval=FALSE}
digitizeRadii("Scale_1.jpg",id="1")
```

Argument values can still be changed from the defaults for a particular call to `digitizeRadii()` by including that argument in the specific call. For example if the edge was an annulus for only one of the structures then include `edgeIsAnnulus=TRUE` in `digitizeRadii()`.

# Data from One Structure

The radial measurements from one structure may be seen by submitting the RData file name to `combineData()`.[^combinedatawd]

```{r}
combineData("Scale_1_DHO.RData")
```


\  

\

# Combine Data from Multiple Structures {#multiplestructures}
Of course, most analyses will consist of collecting radial measurements from structures from many fish. In this section, I demonstrate how to combine measurements from multiple structures.

This demonstration assumes that many structure images in the current working directory were processed with `digitizeRadii()` as described above. For the purposes of this demonstration assume that "Scale_1.jpg" and "Scale_2.jpg" were both read by "DHO". For example, these images could have been processed with the following code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
RFBCoptions(reading="DHO",edgeIsAnnulus=FALSE)
digitizeRadii()  # Use multiple times, select image & enter ID in dialog boxes
```

With this, "Scale_1_DHO.RData" and "Scale_2_DHO.RData" would both exist in the current working directory.

Radial measurements from multiple structures can be easily combined into one data.frame with `combineData()` if the appropriate RData file names are in a list. The `listFiles()` function may be used to identify all filenames in the current working directory that have the file extension given in the first argument. For example, all files in the current working directory with the "RData" extension are identified below.
```{r}
listFiles("RData")
```

This list of names can be further filtered by including other key words for the filenames in `other=`. In this case, the list should be limited to those files with "Scale" in the name and those files with just "DHO" (i.e., exclude "DHO2"). Limiting to "DHO" required limiting to "DHO.", but because the "." is a special character it had to be preceded by "\\".
```{r}
( fns <- listFiles("RData",other=c("Scale","DHO\\.")) )
```

The result of `listFiles()` should be saved to an object so that the names can be given to `combineData()` as shown below.[^combinedatawd2]

```{r}
( dfrad <- combineData(fns) )
```

# Output Data File
Other information about the fish (e.g., location of capture, length, sex) is likely held in a separate file. Below, example "other" data are loaded into the `dffish` data.frame. Note that the `id` variable created from processing the structure images above are characters. In this case, `read.csv()` reads the `id` variable from the external data file as numeric (because the unique IDs were simple numbers). The second line of code below converts these numeric IDs to characters so that this data.frame can be joined with the radial measurements data.frame from above.[^wrongtypesinjoin]
```{r}
dffish <- read.csv("FishData.csv",stringsAsFactors=FALSE) %>%
  mutate(id=as.character(id)) %>% 
  inner_join(dfrad,by="id")
dffish
```

Some people prefer that the data be presented in "one-fish-per-line" rather than "one-measurement-per-line" (as in `dffish`) format. The one-measurement-per-line data.frame can be converted to one-fish-per-line by including it as the first argument to `spread()`. In addition, the variable that identifies the annuli number must be included in `key=` and the variable that identifies the radial measurements must be included in `value=`. The `sep=` argument is used here as well so that the column names in the resultant data.frame are not simply numbers. In this case, the new variable names will be a combination of the variable name in `key=`, the string in `sep=`, and the numbers in the `value=` variable.
```{r}
dffish2 <- spread(dffish,key=ann,value=rad,sep="rad")
dffish2
```

Either file can be written to a "comma-separated values" (CSV) file[^csvfile] with `write.csv()` using the R object name (e.g., `dffish` or `dffish2`) as the first argument and a name for the file in `file=`. Additionally, I prefer to have non-quoted values by using `quote=FALSE` and no row names by using `row.names=FALSE`. For example, the "one-measurement-per-line" data can be output to "Kiyi2014_BCs.csv" as follows.
```{r eval=FALSE}
write.csv(dffish,file="Kiyi2014_BCs.csv",quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE)
```

# Footnotes

[^RStudioSETWD]: In RStudio, the working directory can be set with any of the options under the Session ... Set Working Directory menu.  My preference is to start a script that will contain all of the code described later in this vignette. If this script is saved to the same directory with the structure images then the working directory can be set in RStudio with the Session ... Set Working Directory ... to Source File Location menu items. I then copy the resultant `setwd()` code to my script so that I do not have to use the menu items when I run this script again.

[^inwd]: This assumes that the `Scale_1.jpg` file is in the current working directory. Use `getwd()` to see the current working directory.

[^saveex1]: Actually much more than the radial measurements are recorded in the RData file (see [here](http://derekogle.com/RFishBC/reference/digitizeRadii.html#value)). Also note that the radii are on an arbitrary scale in this case because no scale-bar was available on the image.

[^DRargs]: The many specific arguments to `digitizeRadii()` are controlled with `RFBCoptions()` (described later) and described in detail [here](http://derekogle.com/RFishBC/reference/RFBCoptions.html#details).

[^readings]: The `reading=` argument is primarily used when the structure is read more than once. However, I suggest giving a descriptive label to `reading=` even if there are no plans to read the structure again in the future.

[^excludeextension]: The extension (e.g., "png" or "jpg") will not be included in the resultant R data object file.

[^actuallength]: Some back-calculation methods require knowing the relationship between actual scale length and fish length. See the [Short Introducton to Back-Calculation](../BCIntro/BCIntro.html) vignette for more details.

[^sforder]: Thus, `findScalingFactor()` would be run prior to `digitizeRadii()`.

[^invisiblepoints]: When the structure image is in the "Plots" pane of RStudio, the points will not be visible until after you have finished selecting all points. This is one of the reasons why I prefer to use `sepWindow=TRUE`.

[^twomonitors]: For example, you could have R/RStudio on one monitor and the window with the structure image on the other.

[^sdifilename]: If no file name is given, then a dialog box will appear from which the data file can be selected.

[^noteabove]: The first set of readings were made in the first section above.

[^combinedatawd]: If no file name is given, then a dialog box will appear from which the data file can be selected. It is also assumed that the file is in the current working directory.

[^combinedatawd2]: If no file names are given, then a dialog box will appear from which multiple data files can be selected.

[^wrongtypesinjoin]: The two files cannot be joined by the "id" variable if the "id" variables are of different types (e.g., character and numeric) in the two files. Thus, as shown here, they must be coerced to be the same type. This line of code would no be needed if the "id" variables were of the same type in the two files as would likely occur if the "id" variable was not simply numbers.

[^csvfile]: CSV files are small, portable, and can be opened directly in most spreadsheet softwares.
