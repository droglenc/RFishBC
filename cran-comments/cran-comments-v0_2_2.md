* This updates the existing RFishBC package on CRAN by adding a link to the fishBC software and reducing the size of the tar-ball per CRAN request (e-mail from Uwe Ligges on 2-May-19).

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.

## Notes
* If there is a note about "fishBC" being misspelled in the description, then note that this is not a misspelling.
