* This is the original submission of the RFishBC package.

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.
* Travis-CI and AppVeyor.

## Notes
* There is a note about "fishBC" being misspelled in the description. This is not a misspelling.
* On Win Builder I receive a "ICU init failed: U_FILE_ACCESS_ERROR" error for the "old-release" test. I asked about this error on the r-pkg-devel mailing list and it was suggested that this is a transient error and that other package authors with the same issue have simply noted this on submission to CRAN and their package was accepted.
