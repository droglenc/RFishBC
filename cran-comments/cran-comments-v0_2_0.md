* This updates the existing RFishBC package with new features and less bloat (footprint should be smaller).

## Testing Environments
* My Windows machine.
* Win Builder -- old-release, release, and development.
* Travis-CI and AppVeyor.

## Notes
* If there is a note about "fishBC" being misspelled in the description, then note that this is not a misspelling.
